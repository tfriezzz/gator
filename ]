# gator

gator is a rss feed aggregator written in **go** with a **postgres** database.


## How to Run Gator
0. You need to have **go**, **postgres** and **goose** installed to run the program.

1. Install gator with `go install github.com/tfriezzz/gator@latest`.

2. Create a new postgres database, preferrably named gator.

3. Create a config file in your home directory, '~/gatorconfig.json', with the following content :

```json
{
  "db_url": "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/gator?sslmode=disable"
}
```

(change the connection string to the appropriate url)

4. Run the database migration with: `goose postgres <connection_string> up` 

5. Run Gator in your terminal with `gator`
